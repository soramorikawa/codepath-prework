**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: Sora Morikawa

Time spent: 4 hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
- W3Schools
- StackOverflow

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

- For most projects I work on I like to refer to online resources, specifically video tutorials. I usually find that following along with video tutorials allows me to get a detailed understanding of topics I am not too familiar with. Since for this project the provided tutorial gave us large chunks of code it was challenging for me to follow along and really understand what each and every step was doing. Specifically I am still new to JavaScript so had a hard time understanding the built-in functions such as setTimeout and what the delay parameter represented. Making the buttons light up when the pattern is being played was a challenging concept for me to understand and it was interesting to see how various different times were set to represent the different durations. The backend logic was confusing at first but after viewing the flowchart I began to understand how the program would work. This was my first time working with audio in a program and found that I had to refer to other sources to understand how it works. Tying the audio with the back-end and front-end gave me a hard time. Overall, although it would not have been much of a challenge just to complete the working program, I struggled more to understand the logic of some elements in the program.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
 
- Although I have some experience, I am fairly new to web development. As far as for front-end development I am curious to know how to make a webpage look more up to date. From looking at various different websites it is easy to tell which websites are outdated and I am curious to learn more tips and tricks to improve upon the user experience. I think this is important because from my experience if the website is hard to navigate, I am not likely to return to the website. For the backend I would like to dive more into data management. That is one of the most important aspects of any smoothly functioning website. I am familiar with creating small databases with firebase but I would like to learn more about how the data is affected by interactions made by users. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

- If I had more time to work on this project, I would have made more options within the game. I could have added a feature like being able to edit how long the pattern is, defaulting at 8 and being able to increase or decrease the length with increment and decrement buttons. I also would like to add a timer for how long you have after the pattern is played to return the pattern. In the program that I have created you have an unlimited amount of time to repeat the pattern back but an alert could let the user know that their time is up. Some extra features could be changing up the winning and losing alerts. The default alerts are plain and just could look better in terms of the user interface.
